The Cardinal Health Management System is a real-time database application designed to revolutionize hospital management. Developed using SQL Server, Azure Data Studio, and PowerApps for the frontend, this application enhances hospital operational efficiency by maintaining comprehensive records on patients, scheduling, bed availability, and insurance and billing information.

Our project facilitates administrative decision-making and improves patient care by streamlining processes for appointments, medical history tracking, and resource management. With a well-structured database encompassing over 15 tables and the adept use of SQL queries, we've created a system that significantly contributes to healthcare infrastructure by efficiently managing records of doctors, patients, medicines, and bed availability.
